## Ⲁ version

Wolfia is currently in **alpha** status, which means the following:
- A small selection of games and modes is supported. More stuff is being worked on.
- Bugs during games might happen. Please drop by in the Wolfia Lounge to help sort these out.
- Data and commands might change without notice.
- Output and formatting of messages might look a bit rough.

Being an Ⲁ bot doesn't stop Wolfia from being an Ⲁ wolf with close to 100% uptime though!
